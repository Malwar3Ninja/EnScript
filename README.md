C#.Net DLL COM Demo - Every once in a while I see people looking for help building dll's in the Microsoft .Net Framework for use with EnScript through COM. There are some tricks that are definitely non-obvious, so I put together this package to help.
***
Sample Size Selector - This set of EnScripts aims to give users a method of determining what sample size they should be using directly within EnCase, and then to create a random sample subset of loaded files.
***
Timeline Report - This script gathers file information on all or selected files/folders and presents it in a timeline view.
The user can select the timeframe to check and output Records (EnCase v6.5+), Bookmarks, HTML or tab-delimited text.
