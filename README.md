C#.Net DLL COM Demo - Every once in a while I see people looking for help building dll's in the Microsoft .Net Framework for use with EnScript through COM. There are some tricks that are definitely non-obvious, so I put together this package to help.
***
Random Sample Selector - This EnScript uses known formulas to determin sample size based on a given population, confidence level, and confidence interval. Preferred input is a set of L01's output by EnCase eDiscovery. The script will auto-detect the L01 type - Entries vs Records (Email) - and allow the user to edit this detected setting if incorrect. It will then create a random sample across all of the L01's and output to new subset L01's.
***
Timeline Report - This script gathers file information on all or selected files/folders and presents it in a timeline view.
The user can select the timeframe to check and output Records (EnCase v6.5+), Bookmarks, HTML or tab-delimited text.
