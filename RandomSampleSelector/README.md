The Sample Size Selector EnScript uses known formulas to determin sample size based on a given population, confidence level, and confidence interval. Preferred input is a set of L01's output by EnCase eDiscovery. The script will auto-detect the L01 type - Entries vs Records (Email) - and allow the user to edit this detected setting if incorrect. It will then create a random sample across all of the L01's and output to new subset L01's.
